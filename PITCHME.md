@title[What]

@snap[north-west span-100 text-20 text-bold text-left text-yellow]
What?
@snapend

@snap[west span-100 text-left text-07 text-yellow]
@ul[circles](false)

- Radio astronomy is the study of<br>celestial objects that give<br>off radio waves.
  - Often invisible or hidden in<br>electromagnetic spectrum.
- Optical Astronomy has been around<br>as long as people have been<br>looking at the night sky.
  - RA is much newer.
  - RA is very technology driven.

Ties to Hacker Culture
@snapend

@snap[west span-100 text-left text-07 text-yellow]
@ul[circles](false)

- Depends on how you define “hacker”, but….
  - People driven to learn about or enhance usability of things
  - Coming up with novel and clever solutions to problems you didn’t know you had.
- RA folks have their own tribe, as do we.
  - Heavy involvement in Ham Radio
    - Interest in antennae, wave propagation, chemistry, physics.
    - Lots of opportunity to make your own antennae, receivers, etc.
  - Have their own raft of yearly conferences and meet-ups.
  - People who work as scientists & engineers by day
  - People who run the planetariums & observatories
  - Maybe you and I?

@title[Why]

@snap[north-west span-100 text-16 text-bold text-center text-yellow]
Why is RA Important?
@snapend

@snap[west span-100 text-left text-07 text-yellow]
@ul[circles](false)

- More than just a quest to see what’s out there.
- We don’t know what we don’t know.
- The BIG questions
  - Where did we come from?
  - What’s in store for us as a species?
- Are there ways we can amass knowledge to enable technologies that will enhance and improve our lives?
- Complements optical astronomy.
  - Being able to “see” invisible gasses.
  - Detection of objects whose light is easily obscured by cosmic dust.

Magnitude of Time and Space
@snapend

@snap[west span-75 text-left text-07 text-yellow]

- The shape/size of the universe is a factor of it’s density…
- “The simplest version of the inflationary theory, an extension of the Big Bang theory, predicts that the density of the universe is very close to the critical density, and that the geometry of the universe is flat, like a sheet of paper.”
- The scientific consensus is that we live in a flat, infinite universe.

- Karl Guthe Jansky 
  - (October 22, 1905 – February 14, 1950)
- Considered a “founding figure” in RA
- First person to record radio signals from beyond Earth. 
- Identified the source of “hiss” during long distance telephone calls as [coming from the center of our galaxy](https://public.nrao.edu/gallery/karl-jansky-with-his-milky-way-map/)  

@snapend

Note:

- Later turned out to be a black hole in Sagittarius

- [This is a great place to start!](http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/radioastronomy/)
- JPL made a great primer for RA in 1998. 
  - The PDF is still here.
