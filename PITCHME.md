- I am not a physicist, cosmologist, chemist or other field related to RA.
- My work experience and degrees are all technology related.
- My interest and experience with RA are purely amatuer/hobby related.
- Committed to a life of understanding to the extent possible.
- I do misspeak and make mistakes, there are many things I don’t know (but want to).
- This is a new deck, so I guess that makes you my Guinea Pig. You’re welcome.
- The Otis (onus) for discretionary use of the information presented herein is your responsibility.
- Also I’m not a lawyer, so this disclaimer is invalid.
