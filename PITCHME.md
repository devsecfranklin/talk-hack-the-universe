What?
@snapend

@snap[west span-100 text-left text-07 text-yellow]
@ul[circles](false)

- Radio astronomy is the study of<br>celestial objects that give<br>off radio waves.
  - Often invisible or hidden in<br>electromagnetic spectrum.
- Optical Astronomy has been around<br>as long as people have been<br>looking at the night sky.
  - RA is much newer.
  - RA is very technology driven.

- Depends on how you define “hacker”, but….
  - People driven to learn about or enhance usability of things
  - Coming up with novel and clever solutions to problems you didn’t know you had.
- RA folks have their own tribe, as do we.
  - Heavy involvement in Ham Radio
    - Interest in antennae, wave propagation, chemistry, physics.
    - Lots of opportunity to make your own antennae, receivers, etc.
  - People who work as scientists & engineers by day
  - People who run the planetariums & observatories
  - Maybe you and I?

Why is RA Important?
@snapend

@snap[west span-65 text-07 text-yellow]
@ul[circles](false)

- More than just a quest to see what’s out there.
- We don’t know what we don’t know.
- The BIG questions
  - Where did we come from?
  - What’s in store for us as a species?
- Complements optical astronomy.
  - Being able to “see” invisible gasses.
  - Detection of objects whose light is easily obscured by cosmic dust.
- Are there ways we can amass knowledge to enable technologies that will enhance and improve our lives?

Magnitude of Time and Space
@snapend

@snap[west span-75 text-left text-07 text-yellow]

- The shape/size of the universe is a factor of it’s density…
- “The simplest version of the inflationary theory, an extension of the Big Bang theory, predicts that the density of the universe is very close to the critical density, and that the geometry of the universe is flat, like a sheet of paper.”
- The scientific consensus is that we live in a flat, infinite universe.

@snap[south-west span-35 text-07 text-yellow]

@snap[south span-35 text-06 text-yellow]
This emission is more prevalent in the Universe and penetrates farther than visible light.

@snapend

Note:

- Electromagnetic energy received at the dish is converted from RF (Radio Frequency) to IF (Intermediate Frequency) by mixing it with the output from an oscillator. 
- The IF signal then comes into the rack to my right where it can be attenuated and/or strengthened.
- Finally, it is turned into a voltage that we can see on the strip chart (printout)!
