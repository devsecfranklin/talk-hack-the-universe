- I am not a physicist, cosmologist, chemist or other field related to RA.
- My work experience and degrees are all technology related.
- My interest and experience with RA are purely amatuer/hobby related.
- Committed to a life of understanding to the extent possible.
- I do misspeak and make mistakes, there are many things I don’t know (but want to).
- This is a new deck, so I guess that makes you my Guinea Pig. You’re welcome.
- The Otis (onus) for discretionary use of the information presented herein is your responsibility.
- Also I’m not a lawyer, so this disclaimer is invalid.

- Radio astronomy is the study of<br>celestial objects that give<br>off radio waves.
  - Often invisible or hidden in<br>electromagnetic spectrum.
- Optical Astronomy has been around<br>as long as people have been<br>looking at the night sky.
  - RA is much newer.
  - RA is very technology driven.

- Depends on how you define “hacker”, but….
  - People driven to learn about or enhance usability of things
  - Coming up with novel and clever solutions to problems you didn’t know you had.
- RA folks have their own tribe, as do we.
  - Heavy involvement in Ham Radio
    - Interest in antennae, wave propagation, chemistry, physics.
    - Lots of opportunity to make your own antennae, receivers, etc.  
  - Have their own raft of yearly conferences and meet-ups.
  - People who work as scientists & engineers by day
  - People who run the planetariums & observatories
  - Maybe you and I?
