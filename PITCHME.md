- I am not a physicist, cosmologist, chemist or other field related to RA.
- My work experience and degrees are all technology related.
- My interest and experience with RA are purely amatuer/hobby related.
- Committed to a life of understanding to the extent possible.
- I do misspeak and make mistakes, there are many things I don’t know (but want to).
- This is a new deck, so I guess that makes you my Guinea Pig. You’re welcome.
- The Otis (onus) for discretionary use of the information presented herein is your responsibility.
- Also I’m not a lawyer, so this disclaimer is invalid.

- Radio astronomy is the study of celestial objects that give off radio waves.
- Study of astronomical phenomena that are often invisible or hidden in other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.
- Want to make the distinction between optical and radio astronomy.
- Optical Astronomy has been around as long as people have been looking at the night sky.
  - RA is much newer.
  - RA is very technology driven.
