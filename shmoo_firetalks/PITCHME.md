Note:

- You can **follow along** with this talk on my github (hotpeppersec).
- There are links throughout the presentation that you can click on for greater detail.
- I realize this presentation is currently a bit wonky when viewed on a mobile device.
  - I'm working on it, don't @ me.
- My speaking style is fairly informal and if you stop me with a question I will do my best to answer it.

- This talk is about Radio Astronomy
  - What the heck is RA?
  - What's cool about it
  - How can we even?

Note:

- We will take a very brief look at what Radio Astronomy is all about.
- My background is in computers, networks, sec, software. I'm not a cosmologist or radio astronomer, simply a hobbyist.
- The goal of this talk is to give some background and a starting point for you to hopefully dig deeper, fall down some rabbit holes.

@title[What]

What?
@snapend

- Radio astronomy is the study of<br>celestial objects that give<br>off radio waves.
  - Often "invisible" or hidden in<br>electromagnetic spectrum.
- Optical Astronomy has been around<br>as long as people have been<br>looking at the night sky.
  - RA is much newer.
  - RA is very technology driven.

@title[Why?]

@snap[north-west span-100 text-16 text-bold text-center text-yellow]
But... Why?
@snapend

@snap[west span-200 text-left text-08 text-yellow]
@ul[circles](false)

- Because it's fascinating!
- A chance to set (and meet!) some stretch goals
  - You need to bring your "A game"!
- Still has that small community/greenfield feeling to it.
- It's educational, and suitable for all ages.

@ulend
@snapend

Note:

- RA incorporates engineering, astronomy, electronics, physics, amateur radio, soldering, antennas, cosmology, etc.
- Mention SARA club and get togethers.
