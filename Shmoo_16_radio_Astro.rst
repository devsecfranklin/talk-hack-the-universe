Abstract
--------
*of your presentation limited to 200 words or less for use in the ShmooCon program and on the website.*

I will quickly explain some background on the relatively young scientific field of Radio Astronomy and how it overlaps with things that hold the attention of hackers and tech nerds. I will spend more time in exploration of the intersection of things like Ham Radio, RF Engineering, and Astronomy where we find this fascinating way of observing things about our Universe through the lens of RF signals, chemistry, spectroscopy, inteferometry and more! 

Bio

Franklin Diaz is not an astronomer or physicist, but is a Security Engineer on the Threat Detection Engineering team at Salesforce.com where he builds security tools, pipelines, and environments to capture and process security data using the latest technologies. Franklin believes more testing, earlier in the build pipeline is key in smooth software functionality, and well built pipelines are the path to clean and useful data. He holds two Masters Degree's as well as a BS in Computer Science.

Detailed Description
--------------------
*the most important part of your submission. You need to provide detailed information that 
demonstrates your knowledge of your topic and how you will present it to the audience.  Do not rely on your abstract 
to be enough for the review committee. It isnâ€™t.*

The first few minutes of my talk will cover some background on RA and a few of its pioneers, amateur and otherwise. Then I will spend a larger block of time discussing the tools of RA, facilities and organizations that amateur RA enthusiasts can access for free, and projects and tech that are accessible and fun even in the home lab environment. 

Track Preference
----------------
*describe how you would adjust your presentation for track or time considerations.*

This is probably a good fit for the One Track Mind track. I think 20 minutes is enough time to get the main points across and kick off some good discussions!

*Why do you feel this submission is a good fit for ShmooCon?*

Shmoo has good geographical proximity to some great RA facilities and conferences. Plus ShmooCon is cool. 

*List of other conferences at which submission has been presented or submitted.*

I gave an hour long version of this talk that was not recorded to a small audience of about 50 people a couple years ago. 

*Are you a potential first time presenter at ShmooCon*

Yes. 

*Have you spoken at any other conferences*

Yes. 

*If yes, which ones?*

Codemash
@indybsides (I'm the lead organizer)

    
*If accepted, would you be willing to write a 1000 word article about your topic for ShmooCon Proceedings?*
 Yes.

*List of facilities requested beyond what is already provided (power, projector with VGA input, sound 
projection, and internet connectivity).*

None required.
