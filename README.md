## Abstract

Observe the Universe through the lens of RF signals, chemistry, spectroscopy, interferometry and more.
Consider the intersection of Ham Radio, RF Engineering, and Astronomy w/RA.
This is a great sandbox for makers and hacker types to play in!

- Provide some historical background on the relatively young scientific field of Radio Astronomy.
- Enjoy some pictures and stories about what happens at a typical RA conference.
- Discuss how RA overlaps with things that hold the attention of hackers and tech nerds.
