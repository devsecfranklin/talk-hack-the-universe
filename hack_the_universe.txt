# Hack The Universe

## Contestant(s) name

  Franklin Diaz 

## Abstract

I will quickly explain some background on the relatively young scientific field of Radio Astronomy and how it overlaps with things that hold the attention of hackers and tech nerds. I will spend more time in exploration of the intersection of things like Ham Radio, RF Engineering, and Astronomy where we find this fascinating way of observing things about our Universe through the lens of RF signals, chemistry, spectroscopy, inteferometry and more! 

## Bio

Franklin Diaz not an astronomer or physicist, but is a Security Engineer on the Threat Detection Engineering team at Salesforce.com 
where he builds security tools, pipelines, and environments to capture and process security data 
using the latest technologies. Franklin believes more testing, earlier in the build pipeline is 
key in smooth software functionality, and well built pipelines are the path to clean and useful 
data. He holds an MS in Computer Information Systems from Northwestern and an MS from DePaul 
University, Chicago in Network Engineering/Network Security as well as a BS in Computer Science. 
Franklin is the lead organizer for the annual BSidesIndy security conference.

## Detailed Description

The first few minutes of my talk will cover some background on RA and a few of its pioneers, amateur and otherwise. Then I will spend a larger block of time discussing the tools of RA, facilities and organizations that amateur RA enthusiasts can access for free, and projects and tech that are accessible and fun even in the home lab environment.
